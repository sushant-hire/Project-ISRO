    data: "The space research activities were initiated in our country during the early 1960’s, when applications using satellites were in experimental stages even in the United States. With the live transmission of Tokyo Olympic Games across the Pacific by the American Satellite ‘Syncom-3’ demonstrating the power of communication satellites, Dr.Vikram Sarabhai, the founding father of Indian space programme, quickly recognized the benefits of space technologies for India. Dr. Sarabhai was convinced and envisioned that the resources in space have the potential to address the real problems of man and society. As Director, Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) located in Ahmedabad, Dr. Sarabhai convened an army of able and brilliant scientists, anthropologists, communicators and social scientists from all corners of the country to spearhead the Indian space programme. To spearhead the space research activities, Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR) was set up in 1962 under the Department of Atomic Energy. Subsequently, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) was established in August 1969, in place of INCOSPAR. The Government of India constituted the Space Commission and established Department of Space (DOS) in June 1972 and brought ISRO under DOS in September 1972. Since inception, the Indian space programme has been orchestrated well and had three distinct elements such as, satellites for communication and remote sensing, the space transportation system and application programmes. In 1967, the first ‘Experimental Satellite Communication Earth Station (ESCES)’ located in Ahmedabad was operationalized, which also doubled as a training centre for the Indian as well as International scientists and engineers. To establish that a satellite system can contribute to the national development, ISRO was clear that it need not wait for its own satellites to begin application development, while foreign satellites could be used in the initial stages. However, before trying out a full-fledged satellite system, some controlled experiment to prove the efficacy of television medium for national development was found necessary. Accordingly, a TV programme on agricultural information to farmers ‘KrishiDarshan’ was started, which received good response. The next logical step was the Satellite Instructional Television Experiment (SITE), hailed as ‘the largest sociological experiment in the world’ during 1975-76. This experiment benefited around 200,000 people, covering 2400 villages of six states and transmitted development oriented programmes using the American Technology Satellite (ATS-6). The credit of training 50,000 science teachers primary schools in one year goes to SITE. SITE was followed by the Satellite Telecommunication Experiments Project (STEP), a joint project of ISRO-and Post and Telegraphs Department (P&T) using the Franco-German Symphonie satellite during 1977-79. Conceived as a sequel to SITE which focused on Television, STEP was for telecommunication experiments. STEP was aimed to provide a system test of using geosynchronous satellites for domestic communications, enhance capabilities and experience in the design, manufacture, installation, operation and maintenance of various ground segment facilities and build up requisite indigenous competence for the proposed operational domestic satellite system, INSAT, for the country. SITE was followed by the ‘Kheda Communications Project (KCP)’, which worked as a field laboratory for need-based and locale specific programme transmission in the Kheda district of Gujarat State. KCP was awarded the UNESCO-IPDC (International Programme for the Development of Communication) award for rural communication efficiency in the 1984. During this period, the first Indian spacecraft ‘Aryabhata’ was developed and was launched using a Soviet Launcher. Another major landmark was the development of the first launch vehicle SLV-3 with a capability to place 40 kg in Low Earth Orbit (LEO (Low Earth Orbit) ), which had its first successful flight in 1980. Through the SLV-3 programme, competence was built up for the overall vehicle design, mission design, material, hardware fabrication, solid propulsion technology, control power plants, avionics, vehicle integration checkout and launch operations. Development of mult-istage rocket systems with appropriate control and guidance systems to orbit a satellite was a major landmark in our space programme. In the experimental phase during 80’s, end-to-end capability demonstration was done in the design, development and in-orbit management of space systems together with the associated ground systems for the users. Bhaskara-I & II missions were pioneering steps in the remote sensing area whereas ‘Ariane Passenger Payload Experiment (APPLE)’ became the forerunner for future communication satellite system. Development of the complex Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV), also demonstrated newer technologies like use of strap-on, bulbous heat shield, closed loop guidance and digital autopilot. This paved the way for learning many nuances of launch vehicle design for complex missions, leading the way for realisation of operational launch vehicles such as PSLV and GSLV. During the operational phase in 90’s, major space infrastructure was created under two broad classes: one for the communication, broadcasting and meteorology through a multi-purpose Indian National Satellite system (INSAT), and the other for Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) system. The development and operationalisation of Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and development of Geo-synchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) were significant achievements during this phase.",

Remote Sensing Applications - Remote sensing application projects at National, State and Local levels are being carried out through well established multi-pronged implementation architecture of National Natural Resources Management System (NNRMS) in the country. Major ISRO Centres, namely, National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), Hyderabad and Space Application Centre (SAC), Ahmedabad spearhead all such applications development and implementation initiatives from ISRO/DOS. Regional Remote Sensing Centres (RRSCs) of NRSC, North-Eastern Space Application Centre (NE-SAC), Shillong and the State Remote Sensing Application Centres play a key role in implementation and reaching out to the grassroots for effective utilisation of the technology. User Ministries of State and Central Government departments and other institutions play a major role in utilising remote sensing technology in their own departments. In addition, private sector, Non-Governmental Organisations and academia also utilise this technology in different developmental sectors of the country. National Land Use/Land Cover (LU/LC) mapping on 1:250,000: LU/LC assessment is made using semi-automated approach which includes automated processing of AWiFS quadrant data and classification using rule based approach. Water spread as well as snow cover information is generated though automated process. Rule based data integration of temporal datasets was adopted to derive final LU/LC output. Crop Acreage and Production Estimation: The semi-physical spectral-spatial yield model was developed for various crops and provided to Mahalanobis National Crop Forecasting Centre (MNCFC) and required training is being imparted to MNCFC personnel for running the model and deriving planting date from time series NDVI data. Coordinated programme on Horticulture Assessment and Management using Geoinformatics (CHAMAN): This national level project has been taken up, with the major objectives of (i) area assessment and production forecasting of major horticultural crops in selected districts in India; (ii) geospatial applications for horticultural development and management planning; and (iii) detailed scientific field level studies for developing technology for crop identification, yield modelling and disease assessment. Temporal high-resolution data (LISS-IV and Cartosat-1) has been used for delineation of spatial extent of the crop of interest. A mobile application ‘CHAMAN app’ was developed to aid in faster and efficient collection of ground information, as well as in building geodatabase through Bhuvan platform. Cotton crop area mapping: Multi-temporal satellite (Landsat-8) data was classified and interpreted for cotton crop identification, discrimination and mapping for Wardha Taluka in Wardha district, Maharashtra. Land Use/Land Cover, forest, settlement, water bodies and ancillary data was used to mask the non-crop area. It was observed that around 17,900 ha area of study area was covered by cotton crop (21.4% of total geographical area). The results were subsequently validated in the field. Indian Forest Cover Change Alert System (InFCCAS): A remote sensing based technique was developed for automated detection of forest cover loss of an area greater than 2 hectare for rapid annual monitoring. The forest pixels are identified on Resourcesat-2 AWiFS data (20 x 20 tiles) for Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal). Study on Sundarban mangrove system: The mangrove ecosystem of Sundarbans region plays an important ecological and socio-economical role in both India and Bangladesh. The present study is aimed at analysing the impact of cyclone of varying intensity and at different period of phonological cycle on mangrove forests in Sundarbans region. MODIS time-series (2001-2011), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) products were used to compute the MODIS Global Disturbance Index (MGDI). In the present study, instantaneous disturbance caused by the super cyclones was analysed using MGDI approach. The combined impact of ‘SIDR’ and ‘Rashmi’ was successfully captured by the MGDI images of 2008. In case of ‘Aila’, the disturbed area was reasonably less in comparison to the areas with higher EVI changes (-50% to -30%). The spatial extent of disturbance in each island was mapped, which can further be integrated on a temporal scale to generate spatio- temporal severity map. This will help forest management to identify chronically disturbed areas, which may have potential for biological invasion. Inventory and Monitoring of Glacial Lakes/Water Bodies: The project is being carried out at the behest of Central Water Commission. The inventory of glacial lakes and water bodies was carried out for the year 2009 using IRS satellite data and monitoring in the months from June to October was completed for last four years (2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014). Similar activity for the year 2015 was taken up in June, 2015 for 477 glacial lakes and water bodies. Monthly monitoring reports are submitted. Assessment of Irrigation Potential Utilisation (I.P.U) using geospatial data: The study has been initiated in April 2015 to assess Irrigation Potential Utilisation (I.P.U) under Major & Medium (M&M) irrigation projects in Krishna basin using the geo-spatial data.

The data bases such as basin, sub-basin boundaries, M&M projects, their canal network, river/ stream network and other base layers are being organised. Re-assessment of basin scale water resources using Space inputs: ISRO and Central Water Commission (CWC) jointly executed demonstrative pilot studies in Godavari and Brahmani- Baitarani river basins wherein Space based geo-spatial inputs were used to estimate basin-level mean annual water resources. Ministry of Water Resources recommended upscaling the study to other river basins of the country by regional offices of CWC. CWC regional offices will carry out the study and NRSC will provide technical support and hand holding during the study execution. Monitoring of Gas Pipelines of Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL): GAIL has about 15,000 line km gas pipeline network in India. GAIL and ISRO have undertaken a joint project for studying feasibility of remote sensing, as an alternative/ complement to the helicopter survey, for monitoring the Right of Usage (ROU) of the pipeline for any physical encroachments. A pilot study has been carried out for “Dahej-Vemar-Vijaipur” pipeline segment of about 610 line km. Results indicates that satellite remote sensing techniques (high resolution data) can be used to monitor the pipeline assets through periodic repeat coverage (say monthly) during the cloud-free season. A web application was also developed to demonstrate the usefulness and quick communication within the GAIL monitoring teams. Island Information System (IIS): Department of Border Management, Ministry of Home Affairs constituted a Task force for holistic development of Islands in Maritime zones of India, with participation of all concerned Ministries/ Departments/ Agencies. Towards this, ISRO has prepared a geospatial inventory of all islands using satellite images and developed an Island Information System. A total of 1238 islands have been identified and reconciled by NRSC/ISRO, SOI, NHO and RGI. The Island Information System (IIS) has been shared with different ministries and departments. Monitoring of Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP) watersheds using geospatial technologies: Bhuvan – SRISHTI, a Web based GIS application (Geoportal), has been developed to enable monitoring and evaluation of IWMP watersheds, using satellite remote sensing and sample field data (collected using mobile application). This Geoportal would facilitate monitoring and evaluation of all IWMP watersheds for 10 states and 50 identified districts in 28 states. Bhuvan – DRISHTI, an android based interface tool, has been developed for field data capture of the development activities undertaken for the IWMP Projects and includes a facility to upload photos to Bhuvan IWMP Server. Space-based Information Support for Decentralised Planning (SIS-DP): The project aims at providing web based spatial information comprising of ortho-rectified satellite image, thematic and field data, resource maps, cadastral maps, administrative boundaries, infrastructure layers, climate and socioeconomic data which will act as input for Decentralised Planning at Panchayat level. The project is being executed by respective State Remote Sensing Applications Centres (SRSAC) under the technical guidance and financial support from Overlay of cadastre maps over high resolution satellite image has been completed for 5 States (AP, Telangana, Haryana, Assam and Kerala) and 2 Districts of West Bengal; Bhuvan-Panchayats portal version - 2.0 and Mobile app for Panchayat Raj Institutions (PRI) asset data collection has been demonstrated for operational use. Training on decentralised planning and use of SIS-DP data for planning is being implemented with PRIs through Bhuvan Panchayat. Snow and Glacier Studies: It is a joint initiative of Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change and Department of Space. Retreat/advance for 73 glaciers spread over different parts of the Himalayan region were estimated using CORONA (1965) and LISS-III (2001) images. Snow cover Atlas of the Bhutan was completed. Environment and climate change - Human activities contribute to climate change by causing changes in Earth’s atmosphere in the amounts of greenhouse gases, aerosols (small particles), and cloudiness. Climate change forms one of the most important global environmental challenges, with implications for food production, water supply, health, energy, etc. It is essential to study the impacts of climate change and thereby suggest mitigation measures. Goal of space based global change observation, together with other observations and studies, is to provide a sound scientific basis for developing national and international policy relating to natural and human induced changes in the Earth System. Physical oceanography - Oceans occupy almost 3/4th of the surface of our planet. They have profound impact on climate and weather. The current research includes Advanced Ocean State Forecast (AOSF) using numerical models and space-borne observations, Ocean Process Studies, and development of Data Assimilation (DA) techniques. Biological oceanography - The Ocean contains thousands of microscopic, free floating, single-celled plants called “phytoplankton” capable of making their own food by harvesting the energy from sunlight, carbon dioxide and nutrients present in the upper well-lit layers of the ocean. This process known as photosynthesis also liberates oxygen and makes possible all animal life in the ocean. Phytoplankton are the oceanic equivalents of land plants and forms the basis of marine food chain. In addition, they play an important role in pulling the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by exporting the dead cells to the ocean interior and bottom sediments . Atmosphere - The study of Atmospheric Sciences is a major programme. ISRO centre develops state of art techniques for the analysis and forecasting of the weather and climate from regional to global scales using various satellite data. The space based inputs are used by IMD and other agencies for their forecasts. Cryosphere - Cryospheric studies on the earth surface include inventory, dynamics, changes, and interaction with hydrosphere, atmosphere etc. of snow, ice cover on land, sea ice and permafrost. For the last more than two and half decades ISRO has been contributing to the development of methods/techniques for extraction and dissemination of reliable and quick information pertaining to polar and Himalayan cryosphere using data from Indian Remote Sensing Satellites. Hydrosphere - ISRO carries out studies related to land hydrological modeling and applications. It involves retrieval of hydro-meteorological parameters from satellite and modeling of Hydrological Processes from field to National scale. Timely and reliable assessment of available water resources through satellites and models provide important input to devise strategies and water management in the country.",

These areas would constitute important components for future sustained human space flight activities like rendezvous and docking, space station building and interplanetary collaborative manned missions to Moon/Mars and near-earth asteroids. Gaganyaan project envisages demonstration of human spaceflight capability by launching crew of 3 members to an orbit of 400 km for a 3 days mission and bring them back safely to earth, by landing in Indian sea waters. The project is accomplished through an optimal strategy by considering inhouse expertise, experience of Indian industry, intellectual capabilities of Indian academia & research institutions along with cutting edge technologies available with international agencies. The pre-requisites for Gaganyaan mission include development of many critical technologies including human rated launch vehicle for carrying crew safely to space, Life Support System to provide an earth like environment to crew in space, crew emergency escape provision and evolving crew management aspects for training, recovery and rehabilitation of crew. Various precursor missions are planned for demonstrating the Technology Preparedness Levels before carrying out the actual Human Space Flight mission. These demonstrator missions include Integrated Air Drop Test (IADT), Pad Abort Test (PAT) and Test Vehicle (TV) flights.

These vertically pointing radars sense the fluctuations in the refractive index of the clear air created due to wind turbulence, and measure radar reflectivity and radial velocity (amongst several other data product) from the echo of its own transmitted signal. Wind Profiler Radars helps to study the atmospheric dynamics over seasons, geographies and different heights, by generating the wind dynamics and its profile over elevation. Study of atmospheric dynamics is an important input to the meteorologists / researchers and space scientists for devising the real time atmospheric model and hence to forecast / now cast the weather phenomena.

It replaced the former Freedom of Information Act, 2002. Under the provisions of RTI Act, any citizen of India may request information from a public authority (a body of Government or instrumentality of State) which is required to reply expeditiously or within thirty days. In case of matter involving a petitioner's life and liberty, the information has to be provided within 48 hours. The Act also requires every public authority to computerize their records for wide dissemination and to proactively publish certain categories of information so that the citizens need minimum recourse to request for information formally. The RTI Bill was passed by Parliament of India on 15 June 2005 and came into force with effect from 12 October 2005. Every day on an average, over 4800 RTI applications are filed. In the first ten years of the commencement of the act, over 17,500,000 applications had been filed. Although Right to Information is not included as a Fundamental Right in the Constitution of India, it protects the fundamental rights to Freedom of Expression and Speech under Article 19(1)(a) and Right to Life and Personal Liberty under Article 21 guaranteed by the Constitution. The authorities under RTI Act 2005 are called public authorities. The Public Information Officer (PIO) or the First Appellate Authority in the public authorities perform quasi judicial function of deciding on the application and appeal respectively. This act was enacted in order to consolidate the fundamental right in the Indian constitution 'freedom of speech'. Since RTI is implicit in the Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression under Article 19 of the Indian Constitution, it is an implied fundamental right. Information disclosure in India had traditionally been restricted by the Official Secrets Act 1923 and various other special laws, which the new RTI Act overrides. Right to Information codifies a fundamental right of the citizens of India. RTI has proven to be very useful, but is counteracted by the Whistle Blowers Protection Act, 2011. The Right to Information (Amendment) Bill, 2019, seeks to amend Sections 13, 16, and 27 of the RTI Act. Section 13 of the original Act: It sets the term of the central Chief Information Commissioner and Information Commissioners at five years (or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier).
